# Intended Market

We are targeting fellow movie lovers who are looking to leave their unfiltered reviews and become a part
of our evergrowing community.

# Functionality

- New visitors to the site can:
  - Search for any movie and get a breakdown of the movie's details (title, release date, actors, directors, trailer, etc...).
  - Select a genre and see a list of related movies.
  - See reviews already left by other users .
  - Create an account to interact with the site (Signup, Login, Logout all functional).
- Once signed up/logged in, users will be able to leave a review for a movie of their choosing on the movie details page. As part of the review form, they can also leave a Like/Dislike rating.
- If a user has already left a review for a movie, the next time they navigate to that movie they will only be able to update their existing review. Only one review per user per movie will be allowed.
- Main page will include a search feature, which will be populated with search results.
  - Main page will also display dynamic "New Releases" and "Top Rated" lists of movies.
  - Users can click on any movie poster and they will be redirected to that movie's details page.
